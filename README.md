Subject: Release of the Book Reading Ancient Minds – An Indus Journey with ChatGPT
Dear Sirs / Friends,
I am happy to share that my book titled
Reading Ancient Minds – An Indus Journey with ChatGPT
was released on 18 December 2025 by our alumnus / alumni of eminence, as part of the Golden Jubilee Celebrations (GJC) of the Indian Institute of Science Alumni Association (IIScAA), marking 50 years of service to our Nation, Humanity, and our Alma Mater, IISc. The celebrations continue through Reunion 2025.

This book is dedicated to IIScAA as part of its science outreach initiatives during the Golden Jubilee year.

The soft copy of the book (both Word and PDF formats, including cover pages and main content) is freely available. The material may be translated, modified, adapted, or reworked to suit diverse educational needs, including translation into Indian languages. Readers may also experiment with LLMs as supporting tools during this process.

The book presents a pluralistic, exploratory cognitive-science approach, culturally rooted in the Indian philosophical idea of Unity with Diversity, while engaging with the Indus script. Each seal is approached hypothetically and independently, encouraging multiple perspectives rather than a single deterministic reading.

This work also documents an experiment in collaborative writing using LLMs. The book was intentionally structured using an IGNOU study-material format, with the understanding that it is a starting, working document open to revision.

For transparency:
Chapters 1–10 underwent multiple iterations.
Chapters 11–15 were generated through interaction, with final outputs left unmodified.
Chapters 16 to the Epilogue involved moderate interaction and revision.
Appendices contain deliberate retention of certain errors and stylistic inconsistencies to reflect human authorship and to illustrate the kinds of errors I commonly make.

This is offered as a working model. Scholars and educators are encouraged to modify, adapt, and develop their own versions. Through such engagement, readers may arrive at their own pluralistic or even deterministic insights. The book is meant as a starting point, not a conclusion.

If we work together patiently and persistently, we can evolve better learning material for school students across the country. During this process, even ChatGPT suggested aligning portions of the work with NCERT-style pedagogy. I humbly request that NCERT and other educational bodies may examine this work for possible further development.

Regarding interpretation, I note for example that the first Thirukkural, which is often explained as equating the letter “A” for scripts with God as the first-origin of the universe, may also be read more deeply as affirming language, emotion, and expression as fundamental aspects of human existence.
